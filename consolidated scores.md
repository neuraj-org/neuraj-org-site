Completeness,5,All major architectural and governance components are defined.
Internal Consistency,4,Minor tension between PII ban and traceability; otherwise solid.
Contract Clarity,4,"API endpoints are clear, but data schema constraints need more detail."
Data & Knowledge,5,"Clear separation between truth, performance, and recall layers."
Ops & SLOs,5,"Well-defined metrics, rollback triggers, and latency expectations."
Security & RBAC,4,Strong RBAC and kill-switch; rate limiting and DoS protections missing.
Governance,5,Maker-Checker-Approver is excellent; cadence and audit trails clear.
Ethics & Compliance,4,Bias review and explainability covered; telemetry conflict needs resolving.
Feasibility & Cost,5,Zero-cost-first approach is practical and consistent throughout.
Risk Management,5,"Detailed rollback triggers, incident levels, and thresholds defined."
Integration Readiness,5,AI and OS integration points and compatibility ranges are precise.

Completeness,4,"Core sections present with strong governance and contract definitions. Deductions for missing error schemas, audit immutability mechanisms, and data subject rights."
Internal Consistency,5,"Excellent internal coherence. Roles, responsibilities, and separation of powers clearly defined across all sections. No contradictions detected."
Contract Clarity,4,"API and data contracts well-structured. Needs error response schema, FK constraints, and hierarchical rate limits for full testability."
Data & Knowledge,4,"Strong three-layer architecture (truth/performance/recall). Missing vector store backup policy and explicit encryption specifications."
Ops & SLOs,4,"Comprehensive metrics and SLO definitions. Alert policies, distributed tracing backend, and cost tracking would strengthen operationalization."
Security & RBAC,4,"Solid RBAC model and guardrails. Audit immutability mechanism, session policies, and circuit breakers needed for production hardening."
Governance,5,"Exemplary Maker-Checker-Approver model with clear cadences. Could benefit from explicit conflict resolution and audit retention policies."
Ethics & Compliance,4,"Strong transparency and safety principles. Data subject rights and incident disclosure policies would complete the framework."
Feasibility & Cost,5,"Realistic zero-cost-first approach using PostgreSQL, FAISS/Chroma, Prometheus. Stack choices are practical and implementable."
Risk Management,4,"Good P1/P2/P3 classification and canary rollback. Task timeout, breaking change protocol, and deprecation timeline would reduce operational risk."
Integration Readiness,4,"Clear dependency model and compatibility matrix. Breaking change detection, migration procedures, and contract versioning lifecycle needed."

Completeness,4,"Strong, but missing key process definitions like the Vector Store update workflow and the risk-tier evaluation actor."
Internal Consistency,4,"Largely consistent, but the `tasks` table schema in the blueprint conflicts with the more complete version in `Integration_Context`."
Contract Clarity,3,"The API contract is good, but the Data Contract for the `tasks` table is missing MUST-HAVE columns for SLOs and auditing."
Data & Knowledge,4,"Excellent 3-layer separation. Held back from a 5 by the missing 'Recall Layer' update workflow, which is a key governance loop."
Ops & SLOs,5,"Excellent. Clear, measurable, and realistic SLOs, rollback triggers, and incident response levels. This is a very strong section."
Security & RBAC,4,"Good foundation, but the ambiguity of AI 'co-signing' high-risk tasks dilutes the 'Human-in-the-Loop' principle. Needs clarification."
Governance,4,"Maker-Checker-Approver is solid. The ambiguity of the 'Checker' role and the missing 'risk_tier_eval' actor are minor weaknesses."
Ethics & Compliance,5,"Comprehensive and clear. The inclusion of a quarterly Red-Team loop and mandatory disclaimers is robust."
Feasibility & Cost,5,"The 'Zero-Cost-First' principle, combined with a stack of Postgres, Prometheus, and FAISS/Chroma, is highly realistic and feasible."
Risk Management,4,"Good guardrails and incident plans. The undefined risk evaluation process and aggressive P1 key rotation are the only gaps."
Integration Readiness,4,"Almost ready. The `tasks` schema (MUST-fix) is the only thing preventing NeurOS/AI from being built against this blueprint."

## Grok

category,score,justification
Completeness,4,"Blueprint covers most essential sections but misses backup policies and detailed schemas; strong on governance but gaps in ops resilience (e.g., no DR plans)."
Internal Consistency,4,"Terms like 'Approver' are consistent, but RBAC co-sign conflicts with human-in-loop emphasis; overall coherent across sections."
Contract Clarity,3,"API endpoints listed, but lack schemas or examples; data tables are clear, yet integration with NeurOS/Neuraj AI needs more testable details."
Data & Knowledge,4,"Layers well-defined with engines and retention; however, access controls could be more granular, and backups are absent."
Ops & SLOs,4,"Metrics, dashboards, and SLOs realistic; incident response solid but lacks timelines for all levels; canary/rollback yaml is executable."
Security & RBAC,3,"RBAC table clear, but high-risk approval co-sign undermines human authority; guardrails good but website security unspecified."
Governance,5,"Maker-Checker-Approver model explicit and auditable; cadence and artifacts well-defined with strong traceability."
Ethics & Compliance,4,"Principles enforced via logs and reviews; disclaimers present, but metrics integration for bias/safety could strengthen monitoring."
Feasibility & Cost,5,"Zero-cost-first approach realistic with open-source stacks; no overcommitment on resources."
Risk Management,4,"Rollback triggers and incident levels defined; however, lacks comprehensive risk assessment for data loss or ethical drifts."
Integration Readiness,4,"Contracts and matrix prepare for Neuraj AI/NeurOS; but schema ambiguities may require clarification before implementation."
