## 🗓️ 🗓️ [DATE: 2025-10-25]

### 🛠️ Tasks Done

- Defined Neuraj Organization’s Purpose & Governance Model – Clarified top-level mission and organizational hierarchy (Neuraj Org → Neuraj AI → NeurOS Lite).
- Built Neuraj_Organization_Blueprint_v1.0.md – Finalized first “god-level” draft representing the institutional backbone of the Neuraj ecosystem.
- Created MyriadEye Protocol Package (R1) – Prepared and finalized all four reviewer input files:
    Executive_Summary_v1.0.md
    Integration_Context_v1.0.yaml
    Review_Instructions_v1.1.md
    Neuraj_Organization_Blueprint_v1.0.md
- Ran Multi-LLM Review Cycle – Submitted the blueprint to four LLMs (Claude 4.5, Gemini 2.5 Pro, Grok 2, ChatGPT 4.0) and received four structured outputs each:
    findings.yaml
    scores.csv
    proposal.md
    Blueprint.md

- Merged Findings (Option B – Similar + Duplicate Consolidation) –
    Consolidated 4× findings.yaml files manually and programmatically.
    Created merged_findings.yaml and full traceability log duplicates_removed_log.md.
    Guaranteed 0 data loss; each entry annotated with origin models.

- Initiated Score Merge Process – Uploaded 4× scores.csv files and attempted automated merge via multiple parsing routines (comma, tab, Markdown, hybrid).
    Encountered multiple format irregularities (notably Grok & Gemini).
    Prepared fallback plan for brute-force intelligent parsing.

### 💡 Notes / Learnings
The Neuraj Organization now has an auditable institutional AI governance structure linking all future blueprints.
The MyriadEye Protocol worked perfectly as a distributed review system — each LLM contributing a unique validation lens.
The Hybrid Merge Protocol (automation + human validation) from Scalping Pilot scaled successfully to this org-level project.
YAML deduplication logic proved reliable with similarity thresholds (≥82%) for semantic merges.
Encountered repeated CSV-format inconsistencies across LLM reviewers — highlights the need for standardized review output schemas in v1.1.
Learned that Grok and Gemini exports sometimes use Markdown table structures rather than strict CSV, which requires custom parsers.
Maintaining zero data loss and traceable origin tags was crucial for institutional integrity.

### 🧪 Pending / Carry Forward
- Finalize Score Merge – Run brute-force parser across 4× score files and generate:
    merged_scores.csv
    neural_consensus_map.md
- Blueprint Revision Synthesis – Once scores & findings merged, generate:
    Neuraj_Organization_Blueprint_v1.0.R1.md (post-review reconciled version).
- Audit Index Creation – Build audit_index.json with SHA256 hashes for all artifacts in MyriadEye R1 cycle.
    Documentation Publishing – Sync /docs/blueprints/ and /logs/ to centralized repo once validated.

### 🧭 Micro Decisions Made
[Decision]: Adopted Option B for Findings Merge (semantic deduplication)
Reason: Ensures conceptual overlap doesn’t inflate total issue count.
Impact: Reduced redundancy and increased readability of merged YAML.

[Decision]: Chose GPT-4o over Mistral for fourth reviewer slot
Reason: Accessibility, reliability, and context alignment with Claude/Gemini/Grok.
Impact: Improved balance between reasoning depth and structural clarity.

[Decision]: Hybrid Merge Governance (Auto + Human)
Reason: Fully automated merges risk misinterpretation of nuanced findings.
Impact: Maintains both accuracy and traceable human validation.

[Decision]: Use of Free + Open-Source Tools Only
Reason: Zero-cost constraint for sustainability and reproducibility.
Impact: Stack confirmed: Prometheus + Grafana + PostgreSQL + FastAPI baseline.

[Decision]: Brute-force parsing fallback for scores merge
Reason: Inconsistent formats across LLMs prevented automated parsing.
Impact: Guarantees success of the MyriadEye scoring consolidation phase.
