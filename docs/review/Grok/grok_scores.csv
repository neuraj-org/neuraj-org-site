Completeness,4,"Blueprint covers most essential sections but misses backup policies and detailed schemas; strong on governance but gaps in ops resilience (e.g., no DR plans)."
Internal Consistency,4,"Terms like 'Approver' are consistent, but RBAC co-sign conflicts with human-in-loop emphasis; overall coherent across sections."
Contract Clarity,3,"API endpoints listed, but lack schemas or examples; data tables are clear, yet integration with NeurOS/Neuraj AI needs more testable details."
Data & Knowledge,4,"Layers well-defined with engines and retention; however, access controls could be more granular, and backups are absent."
Ops & SLOs,4,"Metrics, dashboards, and SLOs realistic; incident response solid but lacks timelines for all levels; canary/rollback yaml is executable."
Security & RBAC,3,"RBAC table clear, but high-risk approval co-sign undermines human authority; guardrails good but website security unspecified."
Governance,5,"Maker-Checker-Approver model explicit and auditable; cadence and artifacts well-defined with strong traceability."
Ethics & Compliance,4,"Principles enforced via logs and reviews; disclaimers present, but metrics integration for bias/safety could strengthen monitoring."
Feasibility & Cost,5,"Zero-cost-first approach realistic with open-source stacks; no overcommitment on resources."
Risk Management,4,"Rollback triggers and incident levels defined; however, lacks comprehensive risk assessment for data loss or ethical drifts."
Integration Readiness,4,"Contracts and matrix prepare for Neuraj AI/NeurOS; but schema ambiguities may require clarification before implementation."
