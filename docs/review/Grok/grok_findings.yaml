    section: "5️⃣ Contracts & Interfaces"
    type: "clarity"
    severity: "SHOULD"
    summary: "API endpoints lack detailed request/response schemas"
    detail: "Core endpoints are listed, but without explicit schemas for params or responses, implementation ambiguity could arise in Neuraj AI or NeurOS integration."
    recommendation: "Reference or inline basic JSON schemas from Integration_Context_v1.0.yaml to ensure testability."
  - id: ORG-FND-002
    section: "6️⃣ Security & RBAC"
    type: "security"
    severity: "MUST"
    summary: "RBAC for 'approve_high_risk' allows Neuraj AI co-sign, conflicting with human-only approver"
    detail: "Governance model emphasizes human-in-the-loop, but RBAC permits Neuraj AI to co-sign high-risk approvals, potentially bypassing full human control."
    recommendation: "Revise to require Rajesh final sign-off only; Neuraj AI can recommend but not co-approve."
  - id: ORG-FND-003
    section: "7️⃣ Data & Knowledge Architecture"
    type: "missing"
    severity: "SHOULD"
    summary: "No backup or disaster recovery policy for data layers"
    detail: "Retention policies are defined, but lack procedures for backups, restores, or handling data loss in PostgreSQL, Prometheus, or Vector Store."
    recommendation: "Add a subsection on backup cadence (e.g., daily snapshots) and recovery SLAs."
  - id: ORG-FND-004
    section: "8️⃣ Observability & Ops"
    type: "improvement"
    severity: "COULD"
    summary: "Incident severity levels lack escalation timelines"
    detail: "P1 requires RCA <24h, but no explicit escalation paths or notification chains for P2/P3."
    recommendation: "Expand table with 'Escalation' column, e.g., P1: immediate Telegram to Rajesh."
  - id: ORG-FND-005
    section: "11️⃣ Ethical & Compliance Framework"
    type: "integration"
    severity: "SHOULD"
    summary: "Ethics enforcement lacks ties to observability metrics"
    detail: "Principles like bias mitigation are stated, but not linked to Prometheus metrics or Grafana dashboards for monitoring."
    recommendation: "Add metrics like 'bias_audit_failures_total' to Section 8 for traceability."
  - id: ORG-FND-006
    section: "12️⃣ Public Identity"
    type: "security"
    severity: "COULD"
    summary: "Website hosting lacks security specifications"
    detail: "Contabo VPS and Google Domains are mentioned, but no HTTPS enforcement, WAF, or vulnerability scanning policies."
    recommendation: "Include basic security requirements, e.g., mandatory TLS 1.3+ and quarterly scans."
  - id: ORG-FND-007
    section: "13️⃣ Success Criteria"
    type: "conflict"
    severity: "COULD"
    summary: "Circular reference to MyriadEye Review in criteria"
    detail: "Success includes MyriadEye score ≥4.0, but this blueprint is the subject of the review, creating potential self-referential loop."
    recommendation: "Clarify as post-review target for v1.0.R1 acceptance."
