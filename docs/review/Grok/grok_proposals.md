1️⃣ Purpose
Observation: Section is concise and positions blueprint as constitution, but lacks explicit reference to how it enforces compliance in subordinates.
Recommendation: Add a sentence on enforcement mechanisms, e.g., via contract versioning and audits.
Example Rewrite (if applicable):
- Every derivative blueprint (Neuraj AI, NeurOS Lite, or Departmental Modules) must comply with it.  
+ Every derivative blueprint (Neuraj AI, NeurOS Lite, or Departmental Modules) must comply with it, enforced through version compatibility checks and quarterly audits.

2️⃣ Core Principles
Observation: Pillars are strong and actionable, aligning with overall ethos.
Recommendation: No major changes; consider adding 'Sustainability' for long-term scaling.

3️⃣ Organizational Structure
Observation: ASCII diagram clear, but modules are mentioned without listing examples consistently across docs.
Recommendation: Align with Integration_Context by listing key modules explicitly.

4️⃣ Governance Model (Maker – Checker – Approver)
Observation: Roles and artifacts well-defined; cadence covers frequencies effectively.
Recommendation: Add traceability to governance_events table for each role's actions.

5️⃣ Contracts & Interfaces
Observation: Endpoints listed but schemas vague, reducing testability.
Recommendation: Incorporate or reference schemas from Integration_Context_v1.0.yaml.
Example Rewrite (if applicable):
- **Core Endpoints:**
+ **Core Endpoints:** (See Integration_Context_v1.0.yaml for full schemas)

6️⃣ Security & RBAC
Observation: RBAC allows Neuraj AI co-sign on high-risk, conflicting with human authority in governance.
Recommendation: Restrict co-sign to recommendation only.
Example Rewrite (if applicable):
- approve_high_risk | Rajesh + Neuraj AI (co-sign)
+ approve_high_risk | Rajesh (final); Neuraj AI (recommend)

7️⃣ Data & Knowledge Architecture
Observation: Layers comprehensive, but missing backup/DR policies critical for resilience.
Recommendation: Add subsection on backups.
Example Rewrite (if applicable):
+ ### Backup & Recovery
+ - Daily snapshots for PostgreSQL and Prometheus.
+ - RTO: <4h; RPO: <1h for critical tables.

8️⃣ Observability & Ops
Observation: Metrics and SLOs solid; incident table lacks escalation details.
Recommendation: Expand table with escalation column.
Example Rewrite (if applicable):
| Level | Action |
+ | Level | Action | Escalation |

9️⃣ Versioning & Compatibility
Observation: Versioning clear; integration matrix referenced appropriately.
Recommendation: No changes needed.

10️⃣ Workflows
Observation: Lifecycles detailed; daily brief ties to ops well.
Recommendation: Add visual flow diagrams if space allows, but not essential.

11️⃣ Ethical & Compliance Framework
Observation: Principles strong, but enforcement could link to metrics.
Recommendation: Reference new metrics in Section 8.
Example Rewrite (if applicable):
- **Bias Mitigation** | MyriadEye Red-Team loop quarterly
+ **Bias Mitigation** | MyriadEye Red-Team loop quarterly; tracked via bias_audit_failures_total metric

12️⃣ Public Identity
Observation: Hosting specified, but security aspects like HTTPS missing.
Recommendation: Add security requirements.
Example Rewrite (if applicable):
- **Hosting:** Contabo VPS · DNS: Google Domains  
+ **Hosting:** Contabo VPS (with HTTPS enforced) · DNS: Google Domains  

13️⃣ Success Criteria
Observation: Criteria measurable, but MyriadEye reference slightly circular.
Recommendation: Frame as post-review acceptance threshold.

14️⃣ Guiding Ethos
Observation: Inspirational and aligned.
Recommendation: No changes.

### Top 3 Strengths
Strong governance model with clear Maker-Checker-Approver cycle ensuring accountability.
Comprehensive data architecture with layered truth, performance, and recall systems.
Emphasis on zero-cost-first and human-in-the-loop for practical, ethical scaling.

### Top 3 Risks
Potential RBAC conflicts allowing AI overreach in approvals, undermining human control.
Lack of backup/DR policies could lead to data loss in critical layers.
Ambiguous contract schemas may cause integration issues with Neuraj AI and NeurOS.
