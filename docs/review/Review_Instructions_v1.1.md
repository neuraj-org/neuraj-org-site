### Review Round #1 ‚Äî Neuraj Organization Blueprint

**Date:** October 2025  
**Prepared by:** Rajesh (Approver) ¬∑ GPT-5 (Architect)  
**Purpose:** Parallel multi-LLM evaluation protocol for the **Neuraj Organization Blueprint v1.0**.

---

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Scope of This Review

This round evaluates **only the Neuraj Organization Blueprint v1.0**, which defines the institutional backbone of the Neuraj ecosystem.  
Future rounds will separately review:
- **Neuraj AI (Brain)**
- **NeurOS Lite (Executor)**

Each reviewer must read all context files but limit all judgments and edits strictly to the **Organization layer**.

---

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Files Provided in the Review Package

| File | Description |
|------|--------------|
| **A. Executive_Summary_v1.0.md** | Vision, structure, integration overview. |
| **B. Neuraj_Organization_Blueprint_v1.0.md** | The document under review. |
| **C. Integration_Context_v1.0.yaml** | Machine-readable map of dependencies & contracts. |
| **D. Review_Instructions_v1.1.md** | This file ‚Äì the uniform protocol. |

Each model (Claude, Grok, Gemini, Mistral, GPT-5) receives the exact same bundle.

---

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Objective of Review

Evaluate whether the **Neuraj Organization Blueprint** is:

1. **Complete** ‚Äì all essential sections and definitions present.  
2. **Consistent** ‚Äì no internal contradictions.  
3. **Executable** ‚Äì policies and contracts are testable and implementable.  
4. **Secure** ‚Äì strong RBAC, guardrails, auditability.  
5. **Integrable** ‚Äì ready to serve as the authority for Neuraj AI and NeurOS.  

---

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ Required Deliverables (from each LLM)

Each model must output **exactly four files** in plain text:

| File | Format | Purpose |
|------|---------|----------|
| `findings.yaml` | Structured issues list | Comparable qualitative results |
| `scores.csv` | Numeric rubric (1-5) | Quantitative comparison |
| `proposals.md` | Section-wise notes + sample rewrites | Human-readable recommendations |
| `blueprint_revision_v1.1.md` | Edited version of blueprint | Direct diff comparison |

## 6Ô∏è‚É£ Evaluation Rubric

| Category | What to Assess |
|-----------|----------------|
| **Completeness** | Are all necessary sections and examples included? |
| **Internal Consistency** | Are definitions and responsibilities coherent across sections? |
| **Contract Clarity** | Are API/data contracts testable and unambiguous? |
| **Data & Knowledge** | Are truth, performance, and recall layers well defined? |
| **Ops & SLOs** | Are environments, CI/CD, and metrics realistic? |
| **Security & RBAC** | Are authentication and guardrails robust? |
| **Governance** | Is Maker-Checker-Approver cycle explicit and auditable? |
| **Ethics & Compliance** | Are safety, disclaimers, and escalation paths clear? |
| **Feasibility & Cost** | Is zero-cost-first implementation realistic? |
| **Risk Management** | Are rollback and incident plans defined? |
| **Integration Readiness** | Can Neuraj AI & NeurOS implement this without ambiguity? |

Each reviewer must also append **Top 3 Strengths** and **Top 3 Risks** at the end of `proposals.md`.

## 7Ô∏è‚É£ Review Prompts

### System Prompt
```
You are an expert AI system-architect participating in the Neuraj MyriadEye Review.
Review the provided Neuraj Organization Blueprint bundle and output four files:
findings.yaml, scores.csv, proposals.md, blueprint_revision_v1.1.md.
Follow the schemas exactly. Be concise, evidence-based, and auditable.
```

### User Prompt
```
Context:
- The Neuraj Organization governs Neuraj AI (Brain) and NeurOS Lite (Executor).
- Only the Organization layer is in-scope for this review round.

Task:
1. Read all supplied files carefully.
2. Evaluate the blueprint against the rubric categories.
3. Provide structured, testable recommendations and rewrite examples.
4. Maintain identical file structures so results are directly comparable.
Return exactly the four deliverables defined above.
```

## 8Ô∏è‚É£ Quality Rules

- Each YAML item must have unique IDs.  
- Each score must be justified in ‚â§50 words.  
- No speculative opinions ‚Äì evidence or citation required.  
- All text UTF-8, no proprietary formatting.  
- No API calls, code execution, or network access.  

---

## 9Ô∏è‚É£ Review Consistency Checklist (for LLMs)

Before submission, confirm:
- [ ] `findings.yaml` valid YAML.  
- [ ] `scores.csv` includes all rubric rows.  
- [ ] `proposals.md` well-structured.  
- [ ] `blueprint_revision_v1.1.md` tagged edit blocks only.  
- [ ] File names follow snake_case.  
- [ ] No external data beyond provided context used.  

---

## üîü Evaluation & Merge Process (Human Phase)

After all model responses arrive:

1. Compare `scores.csv` ‚Üí compute mean ¬± stdev.  
2. Merge `findings.yaml` by section + type.  
3. Overlay diffs from each `blueprint_revision_v1.1.md`.  
4. Discuss each cluster (Rajesh + GPT-5) and decide **Adopt / Modify / Reject**.  
5. Produce final `Neuraj_Organization_Blueprint_v1.0.R1.md`.  
6. Record all accepted changes in `change_log.md` and `audit_index.json`.
