Completeness,4,"Core sections present with strong governance and contract definitions. Deductions for missing error schemas, audit immutability mechanisms, and data subject rights."
Internal Consistency,5,"Excellent internal coherence. Roles, responsibilities, and separation of powers clearly defined across all sections. No contradictions detected."
Contract Clarity,4,"API and data contracts well-structured. Needs error response schema, FK constraints, and hierarchical rate limits for full testability."
Data & Knowledge,4,"Strong three-layer architecture (truth/performance/recall). Missing vector store backup policy and explicit encryption specifications."
Ops & SLOs,4,"Comprehensive metrics and SLO definitions. Alert policies, distributed tracing backend, and cost tracking would strengthen operationalization."
Security & RBAC,4,"Solid RBAC model and guardrails. Audit immutability mechanism, session policies, and circuit breakers needed for production hardening."
Governance,5,"Exemplary Maker-Checker-Approver model with clear cadences. Could benefit from explicit conflict resolution and audit retention policies."
Ethics & Compliance,4,"Strong transparency and safety principles. Data subject rights and incident disclosure policies would complete the framework."
Feasibility & Cost,5,"Realistic zero-cost-first approach using PostgreSQL, FAISS/Chroma, Prometheus. Stack choices are practical and implementable."
Risk Management,4,"Good P1/P2/P3 classification and canary rollback. Task timeout, breaking change protocol, and deprecation timeline would reduce operational risk."
Integration Readiness,4,"Clear dependency model and compatibility matrix. Breaking change detection, migration procedures, and contract versioning lifecycle needed."
