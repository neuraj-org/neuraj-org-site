# 🧱 Neuraj Organization Blueprint — v1.0  
### The Institutional Backbone of the Neuraj Ecosystem  

**Date:** October 2025  
**Prepared by:** Rajesh (Founder & Approver) · GPT-5 (Architect)  
**Scope:** Defines governance, contracts, and data frameworks that power Neuraj AI (Brain) and NeurOS Lite (Executor).  
**Review Protocol:** MyriadEye Round #1 — Organization Layer  

---

## 1️⃣ Purpose  

To establish a formal, auditable, and scalable foundation for the **Neuraj Organization**, ensuring that all intelligent and operational subsystems—present and future—operate under a single, transparent, and ethical governance model.  

This blueprint functions as the **Constitution** of the Neuraj ecosystem.  
Every derivative blueprint (Neuraj AI, NeurOS Lite, or Departmental Modules) must comply with it.  

---

## 2️⃣ Core Principles  

| Pillar | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Accountability** | Every AI action must have a traceable rationale, approval, and log. |
| **Auditability** | All systems maintain immutable, human-readable records. |
| **Adaptability** | Architecture must scale without refactoring core policies. |
| **Human-in-the-Loop** | Final authority always resides with the Approver. |
| **Zero-Cost-First** | Prefer open-source, free, and portable tech stacks. |
| **Transparency** | All reasoning, metrics, and decisions remain explainable. |
| **Resilience** | Failure or drift must trigger automatic rollback and review. |

---

## 3️⃣ Organizational Structure
Rajesh (Human Approver) │ ├── 🧠 Neuraj AI (Brain) │ ├─ Planning & Rationale │ └─ L&D / Knowledge Loop │ └── ⚙️ NeurOS Lite (Executor) ├─ Module Orchestration ├─ Task Execution └─ Metrics & Guardrails

**Neuraj Organization** = “Board of Directors”  
**Neuraj AI** = “Chief Strategy Officer”  
**NeurOS Lite** = “Chief Operations Officer”

All subordinate modules (Scalping Pilot, Risk Manager, Profit Trailer, GoldMine, etc.) report via NeurOS.  

---

## 4️⃣ Governance Model (Maker – Checker – Approver)

| Role | Responsibility | Artifacts |
|------|----------------|------------|
| **Maker (LLM / Developer)** | Drafts or proposes changes, builds modules. | `proposal.md`, `patch.diff`, logs |
| **Checker (Validator AI)** | Reviews logic, compliance, and risks. | `review.yaml`, test reports |
| **Approver (Rajesh)** | Final decision authority; merges or vetoes. | `approval.md`, `audit_index.json` |

Governance cadence:
- **Daily:** Micro-reviews and metrics sync  
- **Weekly:** Departmental summaries  
- **Monthly:** Red-Team + Incident Drill  
- **Quarterly:** Policy revision and MyriadEye check  
---

## 5️⃣ Contracts & Interfaces  

### 5.1 API Contract (`CONTRACT-1.0.0`)
- **Transport:** HTTPS / REST  
- **Auth:** HMAC-SHA256 (Stage, w/ timestamp nonce) · mTLS + HMAC (Prod)  
- **Core Endpoints:**
  - `POST /v1/tasks/run` – Execute action  
  - `POST /v1/modules/build` – Scaffold new department  
  - `GET /v1/tasks/{id}/status` – Check progress  
  - `GET /v1/registry` – List available modules  
  - `GET /v1/health` – Liveness probe  
### 5.2 Data Contracts (PostgreSQL + Vector Store)
| Table | Key Columns |
|--------|-------------|
| `modules` | id, name, version, status, owner, created_at |
| `tasks` | id, module_id, action, params_json, status, requester, approver, created_at, started_at, finished_at |
| `artifacts` | id, task_id, type, path, sha256 |
| `governance_events` | id, actor, kind, message, task_id, sha256, created_at |
| `kpis` | id, domain, name, value, unit, as_of, source_sha |

**Vector Store:** FAISS / Chroma for Neuraj AI knowledge recall  
Metadata → `{source_path, sha, section, timestamp}`  
---

## 6️⃣ Security & RBAC  

| Capability | Actors |
|-------------|---------|
| `read_policies` | Rajesh, Neuraj AI, NeurOS Lite |
| `propose_tasks` | Rajesh, Neuraj AI |
| `execute_tasks` | NeurOS Lite |
| `approve_high_risk` | Rajesh (requires Neuraj AI review) |
| `edit_policies` | Rajesh only |
| `kill_switch` | Rajesh + NeurOS Lite [1] |

[1] NeurOS Lite is authorized to autonomously trigger the kill-switch *only* if a P1-level guardrail (e.g., Daily Loss Cap) is breached.

Guardrails:
- Market restart → 30 min cool-down + quiz  
- Daily loss cap → hard halt + manual unlock  
- Max trades/day limit  
- Credential changes → dual approval  
---

## 7️⃣ Data & Knowledge Architecture  

| Layer | Description | Engine |
|--------|--------------|---------|
| **Truth Layer** | Canonical state — tasks, artifacts, KPIs, governance | PostgreSQL |
| **Performance Layer** | Metrics & SLO tracking | Prometheus + Grafana |
| **Recall Layer** | Semantic memory with SHA provenance | Vector Store (FAISS/Chroma) |

### 7.1 Recall Layer Update Workflow

The Recall Layer must remain in sync with the Truth Layer.
- **Trigger:** Any `governance_event` of kind `policy_approved` or `doc_merged`.
- **Action:** A NeurOS system task is triggered to:
  1. Parse the new/updated artifact (e.g., `*.md`, `*.yaml`).
  2. Generate embeddings for each section.
  3. Write to the Vector Store with new metadata (SHA, source_path, timestamp).
- **Audit:** This update task is logged in the `tasks` table like any other system action.

Retention:  
`hot: 60 days · warm: 12 months · archive: tar + index`  

Access:
- **Neuraj AI:** read-only views or NOS API  
- **NeurOS:** controlled read/write per module ownership  
---

## 8️⃣ Observability & Ops  

- **Metrics:** `nos_task_success_total`, `nos_task_error_total`, `guardrail_violations_total`, latency buckets  
- **Dashboards:** `org_overview.json`, `executor_health.json`, `guardrails.json`, `kpis_overview.json`  
- **Availability SLO:** ≥ 99.5 % (7-day)  
- **Error Budget:** ≤ 2 % failures  
- **Latency P95:** ≤ 3 s (read) · ≤ 30 s (build)

**Canary & Rollback**
```yaml
canary_percent: 10
auto_rollback_triggers:
  - error_rate_threshold_breach
  - guardrail_violation_detected
  - latency_p95_breach


- Incident Severity & Response | Level | Action | |-------|---------| | P1 | Kill-switch, rollback image, alert, schedule key rotation, RCA < 24 h | | P2 | Throttle + canary rollback | | P3 | Log + schedule next window |
