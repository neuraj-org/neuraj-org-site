  section: 4️⃣ Governance Model
  type: clarity
  severity: SHOULD
  summary: Clarify cadence of Maker-Checker review cycles
  detail: The frequency of micro-reviews, Red-Team loops, and patching is listed,
    but it's not explicit which events trigger a new blueprint version or MyriadEye
    re-review.
  recommendation: Specify events or thresholds that mandate blueprint updates or trigger
    new MyriadEye rounds.
- id: ORG-FND-002
  section: 5️⃣ Contracts & Interfaces
  type: improvement
  severity: SHOULD
  summary: Data contract schemas lack detailed validation rules
  detail: Field types and constraints for key tables are unspecified, risking ambiguity
    during implementation.
  recommendation: Include a separate annex or markdown table defining data types,
    constraints, and validation rules for each contract schema.
- id: ORG-FND-003
  section: 6️⃣ Security & RBAC
  type: missing
  severity: MUST
  summary: No mention of rate limiting or DoS protection
  detail: While RBAC and kill-switches are well defined, nothing is mentioned about
    API throttling or rate-based abuse prevention.
  recommendation: Add a `rate_limit` policy block in API contracts with default values
    and override rules.
- id: ORG-FND-004
  section: 11️⃣ Ethical & Compliance Framework
  type: conflict
  severity: MUST
  summary: Conflict between 'no PII' and operational need for user-specific telemetry
  detail: Blueprint disallows any PII storage but also mentions audit trails and telemetry
    that might conflict unless anonymization is explicitly detailed.
  recommendation: Clarify anonymization pipeline and acceptable hash/token policies
    for compliant telemetry.
