## Section 4Ô∏è‚É£ Governance Model
- Observation: While governance cadence is defined, it's unclear what thresholds trigger a new blueprint revision.
- Recommendation: Explicitly list triggering events (e.g., critical incidents, 3+ high-risk patches).
- Example Rewrite (if applicable):
```diff
- Quarterly: Policy revision and MyriadEye check
+ Quarterly: Policy revision and MyriadEye check. If 3+ critical issues or >1 blueprint patch within quarter, trigger blueprint revision round.
```

## Section 5Ô∏è‚É£ Contracts & Interfaces
- Observation: Table schemas are defined, but lack field-level validations.
- Recommendation: Add data type definitions and constraints to ensure consistency during implementation.
- Example Rewrite:
```diff
- `modules` | id, name, version, status, owner, created_at
+ `modules` | id (UUID, PK), name (string), version (semver), status (enum), owner (string), created_at (timestamp)
```

## Section 6Ô∏è‚É£ Security & RBAC
- Observation: API access is well secured, but rate limiting is not mentioned.
- Recommendation: Add a section defining default rate limits per actor role.
- Example Rewrite:
```md
### 6.1 Rate Limiting
- Default: 60 req/min per role
- Burst Cap: 100 req/min
- Violations logged to `governance_events`
```

## Section 11Ô∏è‚É£ Ethical & Compliance Framework
- Observation: Conflict between "no PII" rule and detailed audit requirements.
- Recommendation: Clarify anonymization approach or outline tokenization methods.
- Example Rewrite:
```diff
- Privacy: No PII storage; anonymized records only
+ Privacy: No raw PII storage; telemetry uses tokenization (UUIDv4 or salted hash) to ensure traceability without exposing identity.
```

### üèÜ Top 3 Strengths
- Clear governance model with human-in-loop override for all sensitive operations.
- Excellent observability, rollback triggers, and incident handling framework.
- Seamless integration model with AI and OS blueprints via version matrix and contracts.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Top 3 Risks
- Absence of rate-limiting and anti-abuse controls in API layer.
- Potential ambiguity in data contract enforcement due to missing schema constraints.
- Ethical conflict between audit logs and strict privacy promises.
