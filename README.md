# 🧠 Neuraj — Adaptive Intelligence

> **Building adaptive intelligence — from your personal AI → to systems that scale.**

---

### 🌐 Overview
Neuraj is an emerging initiative focused on building **context-aware, adaptive intelligence systems** that evolve with human purpose.  
Our mission is to design systems that **think with intent, act with precision, and evolve with meaning.**

This repository hosts the **public landing site (v0.1)** for [neuraj.org](https://neuraj.org).  
It represents our first step toward unifying personal AI, decision systems, and adaptive trading frameworks under one evolving ecosystem.
